# Mixxx Regression Finder

A small tool for finding regressions in [Mixxx](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx). The tool binary searches over a commit range and lets the user tag automatically downloaded Mixxx snapshots with good/bad.

> **Note**: It currently only supports macOS, since running Mixxx portably on other platforms is quite a bit more involved than launching an app bundle.
